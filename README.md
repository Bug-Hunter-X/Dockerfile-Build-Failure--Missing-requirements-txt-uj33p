This repository contains a Dockerfile that fails to build due to a missing requirements.txt file. The issue stems from the order of instructions within the Dockerfile. The COPY command attempts to copy requirements.txt before it is included in the context.  The solution demonstrates the proper order of instructions to ensure the requirements file is present before the installation command is executed.
